Basic file permission 
 permission groups:

Owner − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.
Group − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.
Other − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

Permission Types:
1. Read : Allows the contents of the file to be viewed.Read permission allows you to list the contents of the directory
2. write : Allows to modify the contents of that file.
3. Execute : Allows you to runt the file and execute a program or script.

To view the permissons on file or directory the command is :
         ls -l <directory/file>
  The permission in the command line is displayed as: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group  
    The following set of three characters (rwx) is for the owner permissions.
    The second set of three characters (rwx) is for the Group permissions.
    The third set of three characters (rwx) is for the All Users permissions.
