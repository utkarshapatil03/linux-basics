Linux partition:
              1) It is useful if we run multiple operating system.
              2)It allow us to divide are hard drive into isolated 
                section where each section behaves as its own hard drive.
              3)There are lots of powerful tools for creating, removing and 
                otherwise manipulating disk partitions in Linux

Two types of partitions :
		1) Primary Partition : this partition contains the booting files.
		2) Extended Partition : this partition contains the storage files for other data to store.


 Steps to create a partition:
             1. list partitions.
             2. label a partition.
             3. Use mkpart to make a partition.
             4. let the partition be created/settle.
             5. Attach the file system to the partition.
             6. Create a Mount point directory.
             7. Add entry in fstab.
             8. Systemctl daemon-reload.
             9. Mount the partition on the directory.
            10. Reboot.

Commands used in this are as follows:
             
             1)list block with UUID Lsblk - fs /dev/vdb
             2)list partitions - parted -l
             3)make label to a partition - parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos
             4)create a partition - mkpart
             5)wait till partition is registered successfully - udevadm settle
             6)format file system with XFS file system - mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
             7)restart daemon service- systemctl daemon-reload
