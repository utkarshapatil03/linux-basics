Linux file system :
       Linux file system is generally a built-in layer of a Linux operating system used to handle the data management of the storage. 
       It helps to arrange the file on the disk storage. 
       It manages the file name, file size, creation date, and much more information about a file. 

Some of the Directories:-
             1.	/bin - this is the directory that command & runs application and programs.
             2.	/dev - Device files are stored in this directory.
             3.	/etc - in this directory the system configuration is present.
             4.	/boot - it contains the boot files that are required to start device.
             5.	/home - this directory contains user's personal directories.
             6.	/mnt â€“ this directory maunally mount storage.
             7.	/lib - this directory contains shared library files.
             8.	/media - it is the directory where the external storage will be mounted when plugged in.
             9.	/root - known as the home directory of the administrator.
            10.	/temp - directory used when system boots and you need to use temp space.
            11.	/proc - this directory stores the information of CPU & Kernel process.
            12.	/usr - this contains unique system resources. 
            13.	/var - this directory used to store data that changes frequently.

                 
Some commands are as follws:
             1. pwd - To find out the path of the current working directory.
                           Ex. /home/username.
             2. cd  - Change the current working directory.
                           Ex. /home/username/Documents.
             3. ls  - Used to view the content of directory.
                           Ex. ls/home/username/Documents.
             4. cat - Used to list the content of file.
          
             5. cp  - Copy the file from current directory.
                           Ex. cp file.txt
             6. mv  - Used to move or rename the file.
                           Ex. mv file.txt/home/username/Documents.
             7. mkdir - Used to make a new directory.
                           Ex. mkdir/Newfile
             8. rmdir - Used to delete empty directory.
                           Ex. rmdir newdir
             9. rm    - Used to delete directory.
                           Ex.rm file.txt 
            10. touch - Create a new blank file.
                           Ex. touch newfile.txt

Hard Link :
A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
Files that are hard linkedtake the same inode number.
Hard links are notallowed for directories.(Only a superuser* can do it)
Hard links are comparitively faster than soft link.

Soft Link:-
A soft link (also known as Symbolic link) acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. It does not access the data available in the original file. If the earlier file is deleted, the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.
Files that are soft linkedtake a different inode number.
Soft links can be used forlinking directories.
It can be usedacross file systems.
Soft links are comparatively slower.
